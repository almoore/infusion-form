# infusion-form

This library is meant for beautifying infusionsoft forms to be more mobile
friendly. 


This can be done by pasting the following into an html block of an infusionsoft form

```css
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://rawgit.com/almoore/infusion-form/master/webform-bootstrap-style.js"></script>
```

If the form is loaded on a page without jquery already available it can be
loaded by adding a source request as such.

```css
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
```css 
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
