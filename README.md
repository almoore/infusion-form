# infusion-form

This library is meant for beautifying infusionsoft forms to be more mobile
friendly. 


This can be done by pasting the following into an html block of an infusionsoft form

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://rawgit.com/almoore/infusion-form/master/webform-bootstrap-style.js">
</script>

If the form is loaded on a page without jquery already available it can be
loaded by adding a source request as such.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">
</script>
